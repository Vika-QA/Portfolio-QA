Hi there! My name is Victoria, I'm a QA Engineer. In this file I woild like to show that I learnt a GIT and GITHub


Some information about my way: 
For many years I worked as a sales manager and project manager in related fields. 2 years ago I moved to another field of testing, For me it was a challenge in the field of professional development, which I am sure I did and am developing in this field even now! 
 I have experience in creating and working with testing documentation (test cases, checklists, bug reports), I am well versed in the methods and types of testing, I know well Magento 2, customization of extensions, and communication with support teams. Have experience working with postman.

I don't stop on the reached, I strive to become better and more professional.
